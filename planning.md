Game of choice
--------------
2048
--------------

- there will be a start game screen in which if you press PLAY it will take you the main game screen (MAYBE, this is kind of redundant since the game starts with your first swipe of the number)
- the game will consist of 16 grids. 
- the game will start with 2 number "2" tiles 
- you will have to use swipe motion to combine the tiles which will give you a new number of "4"
- swipe motion could be done in 4 directions, up down left and right
- with each swipe a new number "2" tile (and sometimes number "4" tile) will appear at a random open grid. swiping a tile any direction will cause the tile to go to the last grid of the board, unless another number tile is already occupying the space and preventing it from doing so. 
- swiping the tiles and combining the numbers will lead to 2048
- there will be a score tracer on top and a goal (MAYBE! because if the game ends at 2048 then you can just track your number by looking at the progress, if i can manage to get the game going beyond that then I will include a number tracer which will track number beyond 2048)
- the game ends if you reach 2048 or if there arent any grids to swipe to. 
- at the end there will be a post game screen giving you a score and winning or losing message
